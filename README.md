# Story Pitch Management System 

## Project Description

Story Pitch Management System is an project design to invert the process of research in the humanities. Instead of aimlessly scouring 
obscure archives in search of inspiration, just start with your ideas and let the scholarly conversation come 
to you !

## Technologies Used

Front-End: ES6, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP
Back-End:  Java, Javalin, Maven, Hibernate
Database:  AWS PostgreSQL, DBeaver
Testing:   JUnit, Mokito Postman

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Awesome feature 1
* Awesome feature 2
* Awesome feature 3

To-do list:
* Rewrite frontend with framework. 
* Wow improvement to be done 2

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the project. 
Open the client in vscode. Open the backend in Esclipse. 
The client is written in vanilla JavaScript, so you can 
use the client immediately by copy/pasting the path to 
index.js into your broswer search bar. The backend api
is build with the Javalin framework, and so runs directly
on your local machine (via the JVM, of course). Simply 
run the file that has the `main` method, application.java. 

## Usage

The application is straightforward. Just type your ideas into the draft space.
When you are satisfied, hit  `Get Recommendations` and the application with take
care of the rest. After a short delay (note, however, that longer drafts => longer delay), 
you will recieve a set of recommended readings, each complete with a title, link, and 
introductory blurb!

### Challenges and Solutions 

Serialization and Deserialization of objects. 
Converting between representational forms proved
to be a little tricky. Javalin's bodyAsClass() method is not very reliable. So I installed 
GSON and Jackson to facilitate converting between JSON Objects and Java Beans. 

Another issue I faced was mapping requests to their targets. Unlike the mapping between comments and requests, a request can be mapped to a previous decision, a pitch, or a draft. A
request HAS reciever id, but this is not sufficient to indicate the function of the request. A request meant for an editor has a different function that a request meant for an author. Moreover, it should not be the case that *all* of an author's pitches are held up because of one outstanding request. So logically, requests should be associated with pitches. But requests are not *necessarily* associated with pitches, so this information should not be placed in the request relation. I could create multiple join tables. I could create multiple request types. The best solution seems to be to create a target_type relation and assign a target_id and target_type_id to the request relation. The problem is that we could not place a foreign-key constraint on target_id, which seems like bad practice. Another solution is to 
maintain dummy tuples in decision, pitch, and draft, and give each request a reference to each like so: 

	...
	target_draft_id references draft,
	target_pitch_id references pitch,
	target_decision_id references decision 
	}

A little inelegant, but straightforward enough. Two values will be -1, and one value will be a positive integer. This can be designated client-side. To maintain referential integrity, we will have dummy rows for decision, pitch, draft, author, and editor. 

UPDATE : A even quicker way to do this is to remove the target_draft_id fk in the request column. Since, 
pitches and drafts are in one-to-one relation, there is no need to reference a pitch directly. Further, since requests represent persistent communication channels organized around some topic, an editor can simply specify the content with the initial comment. That leaves reqeusts targeting editors' decisions. 



One interesting observation is that almost every attribute of a pitch is a target for a query. This makes sense, as pitches are the main product. But it is an interesting observation.


Testing is another issue. In the previous project, tests depended on a database administrator (me) initializing tables from a separate UI (DBeaver). This time around, I used the @order annotation to
specify the execution of DAO unit tests. Generally, the strategy is: add -> query | update -> delete. This should make test suites self-contained.

Requests
My strategy for requests is to have each request have a set of comments associated with it. This way, a user can submit multiple comments in a row, instead of a one-off reply. Then, if the date-time of the latest receiver comment is later than the latest sender comment, we append a red exclamation point to the senders card representation, otherwise, the receiver's card representation. This gives an indication of responses and is more fluid and intuitive.

### Authentication and User Session 
I chose a multi-page front-end. After sign-in, I needed a way to save the user information, so
I used the widely-supported Web Storage API along with JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(). This was
my first time needing a browser session, so it made the mechanics of session storage clearer to me.
